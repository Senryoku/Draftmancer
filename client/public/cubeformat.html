			<section>
				<h2 id="cun">Cube</h2>
				<p>
					The simplest Custom Card List is a list of card names, one per line (see Advanced Card Specification). This will define a Cube, meaning packs will be composed
					of 15 (configurable) random cards from the list without replacement and without regards for their rarity.
				</p>
				<p>Pack collation can be further customized by specifying Slots and Layouts (see below).</p>
				<p>Note: Using a Custom Card List disables the following options: Restrict to Collection, Maximum rarity, Maximum duplicate copies and Foil.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="card-spec">Advanced Card Specification</h2>
				Full syntax for a card line is inspired by the Arena Import/Export format and is defined as follows:
				<pre>[Count] CardName [(Set) [CollectorNumber]]</pre>
				All parameters between brackets ([]) are optional, only the card name is required.
				<ul>
					<li>Count (optional): How many times this card is present in the cube. Defaults to one.</li>
					<li>CardName (required): The name of the card.</li>
					<li>Set (optional): Lets you specify the edition of the card. This is the 3-letter code of the set (e.g. 'GRN' for Guilds of Ravnica).</li>
					<li>
						CollectorNumber (optional): Lets you specify an exact collector number for cards with multiple printing within a set (like Guildgates). Specifying a
						collector number without a set is NOT valid.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>
					The four following lines are equivalent and will add one copy of 'Incubation Druid' from Ravnica Allegiance. Here the set and collector number are both
					redundant as there's only one printing of the card (in Arena, and as of May 2020 :)):
					<pre>
1 Incubation Druid (RNA) 131
1 Incubation Druid (RNA)
1 Incubation Druid
Incubation Druid</pre
					>
					This will add 8 copies of the full art "Unset" Forest:
					<pre>8 Forest (ANA) 60</pre>
					This will add one copy of each of the two version (#243 & #244) of the Azorius Guildgate of RNA:
					<pre>
1 Azorius Guildgate (RNA) 243
1 Azorius Guildgate (RNA) 244</pre
					>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="simple-layout">Simple Layout</h2>
				<p>
					By specifying some card lists (hereafter named 'sheets') and card counts, you can create a simple pack layout. The following example mimicks a basic rarity
					distribution. For more customization, skip this section and continue reading :)
				</p>
				<pre>
[SlotName(CardsPerBooster)]
Card Name 1
Card Name 2
<note>...</note>
[Slot2Name(CardsPerBooster)]
Card Name 3
Card Name 4
<note>...</note></pre>
				Each slot will be present in each booster. For example:
				<pre>
[Common(10)]
Card Name 1
Card Name 2
<note>...</note>
[Uncommon(3)]
Card Name 3
Card Name 4
<note>...</note>
[Rare(1)]
Card Name 5
Card Name 6
<note>...</note></pre>
				<p>Will mimic the distribution of a standard Magic booster, except for the 1/8 Mythic/Rare ratio. Cards in the 'Common' slot don't have to be 'real' commons!</p>
				<p>The following adds a Planeswalker in each pack:</p>
				<pre>
[Planeswalker(1)]
Planeswalker Card Name 1
Planeswalker Card Name 2
<note>...</note>
[Common(9)]
Card Name 1
Card Name 2
<note>...</note>
[Uncommon(3)]
Card Name 3
Card Name 4
<note>...</note>
[Rare(1)]
Card Name 5
Card Name 6
<note>...</note></pre>
				<p>
					Color balancing (if enabled) will be used only on the largest slot (in terms of cards per booster) and if it consist of at least 5 cards per booster. In both
					previous examples, the 'Common' slot will be color balanced if the option is enabled (which is the default value).
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
				<p>
					As the first section, you can declare a
					<code>Settings</code>
					block followed by a JSON object to control some global behaviors of your list.

			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="sheets">Sheets</h2>
				<p>Sheets are simply card lists, with some optional properties. They can be refered to in the layouts section, and assigned to slots. Here's the syntax:</p>
				<pre>
<comment># Header: Name followed by optional properties (JSON)</comment>
[SheetName {"collation": "random"}]
Card Name 1 <comment># Then a list of cards, as described <a href="#card-spec">above</a>.</comment>
Card Name 2
...
				</pre>
				<p>Sheet settings:</p>
				<pre>
{
		<comment># "random" is the default. 
		# "printRun" means cards are picked sequentionally from a random starting point.
		# "striped" means cards are picked as per striped collation (from very early sets).</comment>
		"collation": "random" | "printRun" | "striped", 
		"groupSize": integer, <comment># Only for "printRun". Forces the random start point to be a multiple of this value (default: 1).</comment>
		"length": integer,    <comment># Only for "striped" (required). Specifies the length of each row.</comment>
		"weights": integer[], <comment># Only for "striped" (required). Specifies the chances of different stripe widths.</comment>
}

<comment># Examples:</comment>
[common]                                                               <comment># Defaults to random collation.</comment>
[common {"collation": "striped", "length": 11, "weights": [0,1,1,1,1]} <comment># Uses striped collation from a sheet with 11 columns with equal chances of stripe widths 2, 3, 4, or 5.</comment>
[common {"collation": "printRun"}]                                     <comment># Uses sequential collation, wraps from end to start</comment>
[special {"collation": "printRun","groupSize":2}                       <comment># Uses sequential collation but can only start on 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc</comment></pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="layouts">Pack Layouts</h2>
				<p>
					For even more control, you can specify multiple
					<strong>Pack Layouts</strong>
					describing variations of a pack, each with an associated weight (or probability to be chosen).
					<strong>Important Note:</strong>
					When using pack layouts, sheets must be declared without a
					<code>CardsPerBooster</code>
					parameter.
				</p>
				<p>
					As part of the
					<code>[Settings]</code>
					header, the syntax of a layout is as follow:
				</p>
				<pre>
"layouts": {
	"LayoutName" : {
		"weight": 1,
		"slots": {
  			"SlotName1": 7,
 			"SlotName2": 3
		}
	}
}</pre
				>
				<p>
					Where
					<code>Weight</code>
					is an integer specifying how often this layout will be chosen when generating a pack. By default, and for convenience, each slot will be filled with cards from
					the sheet with the same name. In this example, each pack will contain
					<code>7</code>
					cards picked from the sheet named
					<code>SlotName1</code>
					and
					<code>3</code>
					cards picked from
					<code>SlotName2</code>
					.
				</p>
				<p>Example implementing a mythic rarity:</p>
				<div style="display: flex; gap: 1em">

				<p>
					You can define multiple printings of the same card by varying the set and/or the collector number while keeping the name. Referring to these cards by name only
					(without specifying a set and a collector number) will always mean the first occurence. Duplicate cards by name will inherit all the properties of the first
					occurence, meaning that besides the name you only have specify the properties that are actually modified in the other printings. In the following example, only
					the first 'Nazgûl' has all the properties, the other ones will be completed automatically. Note how you can now refer to individual printings using the
					'CardName (SET) Number' syntax.

				The mana cost field follows
				<a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/api/card-symbols/all" target="_blank">Scryfall Symbology</a>
				(e.g. "{5}{G}{G}"). The image_uris and printed_names fields are objects with the language as key and the localized image URL or name as value (see previous
				example).

				You can apply some effects from Conspiracy cards to your custom cards using the
				<code>draft_effects</code>
