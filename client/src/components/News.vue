				<font-awesome-icon icon="fa-solid fa-trophy"></font-awesome-icon> I rewrote the tournament bracket
				system to be more robust and maintainable. Please me let me know if you encounter any regression!
			</p>
			<p>
				As a first improvement to the tournament brackets and thanks to the help of Danbopes from
				<a href="https://mtgbot.tv/donate" target="_blank">MTGBot</a>, you can now enable the experimental
				"Sync. with MTGO matches" setting in your tournament bracket and Draftmancer will automatically populate
				it with you match results!<br />Make sure everyone use their MTGO screen names for this to work properly
				;)

				Reworked the way Minesweeper Draft grids are generated, allowing the use of standard MTG sets and
				lifting some restrictions for cubes.
