			<p>

			<p>MTGADraft.tk becomes <strong>Draftmancer.com</strong>!</p>
			<p>
				Nothing else changes, I'll keep the previous domain around for as long as possible, but
				<a href="https://draftmancer.com">Draftmancer.com</a> is now the official URL.
			</p>
			<p>
				Settings and, more importantly, Game Logs are tied to the domain. If you want to keep them,
				<strong>Backup your Game Logs</strong> before switching to the new domain name.
